# Overview
Mysto_realisticexplosion is a simple STANDALONE script that has a realistic and cool explosion effect when a vehicle is blown up, as well as when it is taken off of a height. This can be set in the config.lua

# Dependencies
1. A working FiveM server
2. Anticheat that allows vehicle explosions and that does not block it (needs to be done manually with anticheats like PAC, etc)

# Installation
1. Download the file above via downloading the zip (green code button)
2. Drag and drop `mysto_realisticexplosion` into any folder (make sure to start it in the server.cfg by doing: ensure mysto_realisticexplosion if you are not starting your resources by folder already).
3. Restart your server. To ensure that there are no bugs, and if you have made any changes to your server.cfg, we recommend that you restart your server.

# Performance
Resmon is important. This resource has a resmon of `0.0` at all times, including idle and in usage.
